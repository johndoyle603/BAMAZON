I'm fairly happy with my code. Got tons of help from classmates via online video sttudy session, but mucho thanks to Dave Ward, who really helped me a lot. 

Unfortunately, I got an error that despite my best efforts (and certainly Dave's), I couldn't resolve. Apparently I couldn't connect the javascript to the MYSQL database, saying it didn't exist. Though it does exist! Anyway, if you have any insights, please let me know because I'd love to get this thing working. 

I spentt about 11 hours on this project. Thanks for any advice you can give me. JD
